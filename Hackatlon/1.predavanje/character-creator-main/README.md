# Character Creator

This is an AI-powered character creator app. The idea is to input some basic parameters which are afterwards sent to the
DALL-E AI engine. The engine replies with an url of the generated image. The app is used to create images of fictional
video game characters.

The app is created for the FER FrontED workshop and should be used as learning material for React basics.
